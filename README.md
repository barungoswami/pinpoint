# PinPoint

## REI Hiking Application

## Responsive web/mobile application

### PinPoint is an Image Recognition Application that allows users to take a photo and learn the details of the photo contents. Meant to be used while hiking, this Application aims to bridge the gap between objects in nature that hiker's know about, and those they do not know about. It's as simple as taking a photo of the unknown.
